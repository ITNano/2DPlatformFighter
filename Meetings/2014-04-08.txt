2. Objectives:
	2.1 Structure up the classes into packages.
        	Code was separated into the packages: main, model, view, eventbus, util,
		controller, services with some sub-packages in the bigger ones.

3. Discussion items:
        3.1 How do we do:
	         General structure of the code.
        	        We will use XML:s for most of the data reading, for this we will use
			XStream.




	3.2 What to do:
        	 --- 
        3.3 Why is:
        	 ---

4. Outcomes and assignments:
        Look deeper into XStream to check if it truly meets our needs.
	Continue coding our respective parts.
	Continue overall structuring of the code.
5. Wrap up:
        5.1 Unsolved issues
	5.2 Next meeting
