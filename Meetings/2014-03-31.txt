Meeting Agenda 2014-03-31
Meeting begins at: 15:20
Participants: Matz Larsson, Patrik Haar, Lisa Lipkin, David Gustafsson

1. Reports from previous meeting:
Members have not looked into tiled map editor.         
2. Objectives:
         2.1 Divide work responsibilities.
2.2 Sequence map
        made a sequence map of the UC move.
2.3 Discuss possibility of creating a proper design model uml
Started with some of the most important classes in our program, though we won’t be able to finish something complete till thursday

3. Discussion items:
        3.1 How do we do:
         Javadoc
It is much easier for the group members to understand if there is javadoc, therefore we will write javadoc on all methods.
                Check up with work even though meeting time is sparse.
                        We will try to find meeting times that fits everyone. If this is not possible,
                        Skype may be an alternative solution. Also, a Google Calender will be
                        used to plan meetings in a more flexible way.
3.2 What to do:
         --- 
         3.3 Why is:
         ---

4. Outcomes and assignments:
All code will be documented with javadoc even though this is not compulsory
A Google Calendar will be created and used for easier scheduling.
        Lisa will create the above mentioned calendar.


Code for the demo will be produced by all members with responsibilities as follows:
        David - Basic logic for an easy TestGame for the demo (controller + view)
        Matz - World and collision detection
        Lisa - Map together with TiledMap and some of the World-parts.
        Patrik - Movement for the character

5. Wrap up:
        5.1 Unsolved issues
