1. Reports from previous meeting:
	The unsolved issues from previous meeting has been added to the agenda of this
	meeting.
2. Objectives:
         2.1 Discuss library
		Is slick2D the best choice? We look at libGDX and find quite a lot of information about the libGDX and good videos. libGDX is possible to switch to other platforms, that’s a positive. 
		However there seems to be problems when libGDX is used with Maven, therefore we will continue with Slick2D.

        	The analysis has been improved and fixed. It now contains elements with more
        	specific names and useful working areas. Some unnecessary items have been
