<!--
	Effects are used in various skillcomponents and you can often have however many you'd like.
	They are built by the node which specifies what kind of effect it is followed by
	attributes (surrounded by stars are optional) and a value to customize it.
	
	Like this:
-->
	<effectname att1="Atrribute nr1">Value</effectname>




<!-- Here is a list of all currently available effects and how to make them -->

<damage>Value</damage>
	<!--
		<damage>:	This effect will deal damage when applied to a valid target.
		
		Value:		The damage to be dealt as a float.
	-->

<heal>Value</heal>
	<!--
		<heal>:		This effect will heal when applied to a valid target.
		
		Value:		The health to be healed as a float.
	-->
	
<push ***aim="1,1"*** ***offset="15"***>Value</push>
	<!--
		<push>:		This effect will push when applied to a valid target.
		
		aim:		(Optional) This will override the objects relevant Vector and use this
					Vector instead, two floats separated by a comma.
		offset:		(Optional) This will angle the push in degrees upwards if positive
					downwards if negative.
		Value:		The power with which to push as a float.
	-->
	
<damage_over_time ***duration="5000"*** ***intervall="1000"***>Value</damage_over_time>
	<!--
		<damage_over_time>:	This effect will apply a dot to a valid target.
		
		duration:		(Optional) this will set the duration of the effect
		intervall:		(Optional) this will set the intervall between the ticks.
		Value:		The amount of damage the dot will apply with each tick.
	-->
	
<heal_over_time ***duration="5000"*** ***intervall="1000"***>Value</heal_over_time>
	<!--
		<heal_over_time>:	This effect will apply a heal over time to a valid target.
		
		duration:		(Optional) this will set the duration of the effect in milliseconds.
		intervall:		(Optional) this will set the intervall between the ticks in milliseconds..
		Value:		The amount of healing the healing over time will apply with each tick.
	-->
	
<slow  ***duration="5000"*** ***percent="0"*** ***static="1,1"***></slow>
	<!--
		<slow>:	This effect will apply a slow to a valid target.
		
		duration:		(Optional) this will set the duration of the effect in milliseconds.
		percent:	(Optional) this will scale the targets movementspeed in percent
						 a negative number will slow the target a postive will increase it's speed 
		static:		(Optional) this will add a velocity vector statically to the target over the duration.
	-->
**************************************************************************************************************
							static probably won't work without resetting the speed
**************************************************************************************************************
<speed  ***duration="5000"*** ***percent="0"*** ***static="1,1"***></speed>
	<!--
		<speed>:	This effect will apply a speedup to a valid target.
		
		duration:		(Optional) this will set the duration of the effect in milliseconds.
		percent:	(Optional) this will scale the targets movementspeed in percent
						 a negative number will slow the target a postive will increase it's speed 
		static:		(Optional) this will add a velocity vector statically to the target over the duration.
	-->
		
<push_over_time  ***duration="5000"*** ***power="100"*** ***aim="1,1"*** ***aimOffset="10"***></push_over_time>
	<!--
		<push_over_time>:	This effect will push and remove the gravity of a valid target 
							over a specific time.
		
		duration:		(Optional) this will set the duration of the effect. Default 5000.
		power:			(Optional) this will push the target with velocity based on power and 
						it's own aim. Default is 1.
		aim:			(Optional) Set this and it will override the transmitters own aim.
		aimOffset:		(Optional) The offset of the aim in degrees upwards.
	-->
<shield  ***duration="5000"***   ***priority="0"***>Value</shield>
	<!--
		<shield>:	This effect will put on a shield to a valid target 
					over a specific time.
		
		duration:		(Optional) this will set the duration of the effect
		priority:		(Optional) this will set the priority of the effect a lower prority number
						will take damage first.
		value:			The amount of damage the shield effect can take.
	-->
<damage_immunity  ***duration="5000"***   ***priority="0"***></shield>
	<!--
		<damage_immunity>:	This effect will put on a render a valid target 
							immune to damage.
