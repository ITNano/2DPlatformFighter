This is a document to help showcase the current possible ways to build a projectile.
Some information is handled by the nodes value-node inside another node <node>Value</node>.
Some information is handled by the attributes of the nodes (see name below).
Some of these are mandatory while others are optional for customization.
The optional ones are surrounded by three stars in the document below.

<projectile ***name="exampleprojectile_1"***>
	<!-- 
		name:	(Optional) This is not currently used but is nice to have.
	-->

	<hitbox shape="rectangle" parameters="30,40"></hitbox>
		<!--
			This will build the hitbox with the given shape and the parameters
			for that shape separated by commas.
			
			The possible shapes are:
			Rectangle	shape: "rectangle" (as is)
						parameters: "width,height" (in floats)
			Circle		shape: "circle" (as is)
						parameters: "radius" (in float)
			Ellipse		shape: "ellispe" (as is)
						parameters: "width,height" (in floats)
		-->
	
	<speed ***gravity="0,100"***>1000</speed>
		<!--
			Value: The speed of the projectile given in a float.
			
			gravity: (Optional) Using this attribute the default gravity affecting
								the projectile will be overridden by the new given
								Velocity-Vector parameters separated by a comma ("x-value,y-value")
		-->
		
	<lifetime>5000</lifetime>
		<!--
			Value: How long the projectile will stay active in milliseconds

	<effects>
		<effect>...</effect> x?
		<!--
			Effects is all the effects on the projectile, you can have however many you'd like.
			Check out the EFFECT BUILDER HELP for info on how to make effects.
